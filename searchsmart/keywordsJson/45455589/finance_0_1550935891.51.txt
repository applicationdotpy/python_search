European Union s FS industry would have a significantly different shape , but that the CBI in exercise of its gatekeeper role as a European regulator had prepared the ground well for the paradigm shift that Brexit is , a fact that he was very proud of . <br>\n","Brexit would lead to a real change in the regulation of financial services in Europe he said , an event , the incoming ECB chief economist described as a paradigm shift rather than as a cyclical event . <br>\n","That event , if it transpired in the form of a disorderly , hard , Brexit could result in a shock to Irish GDP of 4 percentage points impacting within about a year of the event , CBI economic modellers had estimated . <br>\n","Underlying growth he added , though , was still strong enough to ensure that growth would continue in Ireland . <br>\n","Brexit thus far has been a positive development for IFS , as IDA Ireland wins a record 60 new investments in 2018 . <br>\n","In 2018 , IDA Ireland won a record 60
